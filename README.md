Usage
On the homepage, you will see a list of your todos. If there are no todos, it will display a message indicating that there are no todos to display.

To add a new todo, click on the "Add a todo" button at the top of the page. Fill in the title and description for the new todo and click the "Add Todo" button.

To delete a todo, click on the "Delete" button next to the todo you want to remove.

You can navigate to the "About" page by clicking on the "About" link in the navigation bar. The About page provides some information about the Todo List application.

The application automatically saves your todos in the browser's local storage, so you can close the application and reopen it later to see your saved todos.

Available Scripts
In the project directory, you can run the following scripts:

npm start
Runs the application in development mode.
Open http://localhost:3000 to view it in the browser.

The page will automatically reload if you make changes to the code.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

npm test
Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.
See the running tests documentation for more information.

npm run build
Builds the application for production to the build folder.
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

npm run eject
Note: This is a one-way operation. Once you eject, you can't go back!

Removes the single build dependency from your project and copies configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, etc.) into the project, so you have full control over them.
